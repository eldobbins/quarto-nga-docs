    "text": "Python\n\n\n\n\n\nPython is essentially an open source programming language. But the Python ecosystem encompasses a dizzying constellation of tools, packages, disciplines, and organizations. The center is the Python Standard Library - a set of built-in functions and modules. But anyone can build extensions to that called packages.\nBecause of these layers, it is sometimes difficult to know how to find information on the particular object type or function that you want to use. Another difficulty is the big disconnect between basic tutorials that cover Python syntax and the modern packages that are used to actually do the work. Those packages often are so abstract that you might not need to know much syntax to do some really cool things.\nIt is suggested that you learn the rudiments of the language and learn to read documentation. Memorize the basic syntax to ease understanding more complicated code later. But don’t view Numpy and Matplotlib as the next step! You should jump to packages like to Pandas and Xarray as soon as you can, because they wrap most plotting and array manipulations in a much easier syntax.\n\nDocumentation\n\nMost recent Python Docs\nThe Python Standard Library\n\n\n\nTutorials\nPython learning resources have exploded in recent years because of its usefulness in fields like Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI). All the big online education companies (Coursera, Udemy, etc.) offer Python classes. But you don’t need a whole course to get started. Here are some online tutorials oriented to scientific programming or even oceanography specifically.\n\nPython for Non-Programmers\nThe Carpentries offers several Python tutorials\n\nData Analysis and Visualization in Python for Ecologists: jumps right into pandas\nPython for Atmosphere and Ocean Scientists is a community developed lesson specifically for Ocean and Atmospheric science using Xarray\nPlotting and Programming in Python: using pandas and gapminder data\n\nOur Coding Club has several science related Python tutorials\nDatalab at Rutgers University has several oceanography specific tutorials prepared for REU students during the online 2020 season.\n\n\n\nRelevant Packages\n\nGeneral Data Manipulation\n\npandas: data analysis and manipulation tool for 1D and 2D data - like for data easily stored in CSV (comma separated values) files and tables.\n\npandas docs. Pandas documentation is some of the best documentation around!\npandas Getting started tutorials\n\nXarray: N-D labeled arrays and datasets in Python - like for netCDF files and model output.\n\nXarray docs\nXarray Tutorial\n\n\n\n\nEarth Sciences\n\nSci-tools: powerful Python-based open-source tools for Earth scientists. Includes:\n\nCartopy is a Python package designed for geospatial data processing in order to produce maps and other geospatial data analyses.\ncf-units is a wrapper class to support Unidata/UCAR UDUNITS-2\nIris is a powerful tool used for manipulating multi-dimensional earth science data\n\n\n\n\nSpecifically Oceanographic\n\nGibbs Sea Water Toolbox: Python implementation of the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10)\ncmocean: Beautiful colormaps for oceanography\nA stack of GitHub repos called POceans: Python modules for oceanography\n\nIncludes list of packages called SEA-PY: Python Tools for Oceanographic Analysis\n\nAnother list from the SOEST, University of Hawaii: The Python scientific stack for oceanography\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Tools\nSeveral types of additional tools will make your Python experience much better. First, because packages make Python so powerful, proficiency with package management (pip, conda, mamba) is essential. Second, whereas MATLAB and R have a single primary integrated development environment (IDE), Python has multiple possibilities such as Spyder, PyCharm, or VSCode; using one of these makes debugging so much easier. Lastly, you can mix Markdown and Python in Jupyter Notebooks, or even use Jupyter Lab as an IDE.\n\nPackage Management\n\nStandard Package Managment (pip)\nConda Users Guide - package management using virtual environments\nMamba Docs - like conda but much faster for virtual environments with complicated packages and dependencies.\n\n\n\nIDEs\n\nSpyder the Scientific Python Development Environment written in Python and distributed as a package.\nPyCharm, “The Python IDE for Professional Developers”\nVSCode is a code editor for multiple languages that has a Python extension.\nPythonTutor is not an IDE, but can be used to visualize code operation as the debugger of an IDE would.\n\n\n\nJupyter Notebooks\n\nJupyter Notebooks, “A computational … shareable document that combines computer code, plain language descriptions, data, rich visualizations like 3D models, charts, graphs and figures, and interactive controls.”\nJupyterLab is a “highly extensible, feature-rich notebook authoring application and editing environment”. That means you run Notebooks in Jupyter Lab.\nGoogle Colaboratory (Colab): write and execute Python in your browser. Not exactly Jupyter, but pretty close.\nResearch Workspace, the platform that NGA LTER uses for data management, includes Jupyter Notebooks within that environment."
