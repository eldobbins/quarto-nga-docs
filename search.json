    "text": "This four week workshop will introduce undergraduate students to current best practices regarding reproducible scientific research and data. Whereas the previous version of this workshop included Carpentries lessons for hands on practice, four weeks might not be long enough to to include those. Instead, the emphasis is on motivations and developing the culture of Open Science. This will hopefully enable further exploration of these topics by the students on their own. As such, this workshop is meant to be an introduction to topics students will confront if they continue as a graduate student or scientist."

She has collected data at sea, processed sensor data, mapped assets, utilized numerical models, and used open-source Python tools to ingest data into a public-facing data portal. She is a certified Carpentries instructor and is eager to talk about best practices regarding scientific computing."
