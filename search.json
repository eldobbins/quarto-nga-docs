Different organizations have extended the original concept, so you will probably run across different version of it.\n\nFor short lists of tags, Google markdown cheatsheet. For example Cheatography’s The Ultimate Markdown Cheat Sheet\nJohn Gruber’s Markdown Syntax - the original from 2004.\nGitHub Flavored Markdown Spec - for README files and other documents rendered within a GitHub repository.

Python’s Numpy is mainly written in C and C++, but it can use pre-compiled Linear Algebra libraries (OpenBLAS or MKL) which might have been written in FORTRAN. R can also link to Fortran code.\n\nThere are different open source and commercial Fortran compilers, so it is best to look at the documentation for the one you are using. For instance:\n\nGNU Fortran Compiler (gfortran)\nIntel’s Fortran Compiler (ifc) and Fortran Compiler Classic (ifort)\n\nOur Coding Club’s Introduction to Fortran\nfortran-lang.org’s Learn Fortran series\nIDEs (analogous to MATLAB and RStudio) are available for Fortran as well.

The workshop was held remotely via Zoom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis eight week workshop will introduce undergraduate students to current best practices regarding reproducible scientific research and data. The first four weeks will focus on data at different stages of a research project, and how data might live on after the original project is complete. The next four weeks will cover basic tools that enable open science. This workshop is meant to be an introduction to topics students will confront if they continue as a graduate student or scientist. Each lesson will include real-world examples and time for interactive practice.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis lesson will explain the motivation behind thinking about data as its own thing, regardless of scientific discipline or results. This is the set-up for the rest of the lessons.\n\nWhat is reproducible research?\n\nWhy is it important?\n\nDescription of the research data lifecycle (collection, preservation, publication, etc)\nIntro to best practices (scripting, metadata, preferred data formats, standards)\n\nArchiving your own data so it will live on\n\n\n(Introduce the data to download for the next lesson)\n\n\n\nMuch of a scientist’s work is data wrangling - the process of collecting and organizing data so that analysis can be done.
