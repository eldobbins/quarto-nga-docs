## Last Week

::: {.incremental}
1. Intro to Programming (Python)
2. Programming Best Practices
3. Practiced Best Practices
:::

::: {.notes}
One hour bare-bones Python lesson in Colab

The Notebooks have been copied to this website.
:::

## Today: Data Life Cycle

![Data Life Cycle. [DataONE Best Practices](https://dataoneorg.github.io/Education/bestpractices/)](images/dataone_data_life_cycle.png)


::: {.notes}
In the first week, I introduced this concept. Been described many different ways.

While you are collecting and preparing data for your own analysis, are also thinking of future uses. etc.
:::


## Signature Data Example

* Plan: LTER has extensive data management
* Collect: Multiple PIs, many years
* Assure: Best quality. Nicely formatted.
* Describe: There is some metadata on the [NGA website](https://nga.lternet.edu/data-overview/signature-datasets/)
* Preserve: Website includes [links to archive](https://search.dataone.org/portals/NGALTER/Data)
* Discover: Informal
* Integrate: Future possibilities
* Analyze: Python/pandas

::: {.notes}
* Used an NGA LTER Signature Dataset
* How does that illustrate the Data Life Cycle?

Tidy Data !!!

## Definition of "Tidy Data"

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

Wickham, Hadley. 2014. “Tidy Data”. *Journal of Statistical Software* 59 (10):1-23. [https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v059.i10](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v059.i10).

::: {.notes}
Oh, that's easy! What isn't tidy?
:::

## Example of Messy Data

A table of weights:

|Plot | SpeciesA | SpeciesB |
|-----|----------|----------|
|1 | 3.5 | 1.2 |
|2 | 2.8 | 4.2 |

<br />

* the variable `weight` is found in multiple columns
* there are 2 types of species so those are actually variables
  * variables should not be used as column headers

::: {.notes}
Messy doesn't mean it isn't useful. Can be good in paper. Efficient storage.

However, it is hard for a computer to extract data from this table
:::

## Same Data, Now Tidy

|Plot | Species | Weight  |
|-----|---------|---------|
| 1 | A | 3.5 |
| 1 | B | 1.2 |
| 2 | A | 2.8 |
| 2 | B | 4.2 |

<br />

* each row is an observation
* queries are easier

::: {.notes}
* `Plot==1 & Species==A`
:::


## Other Qualities of Tidy Data

* Units not included in cell with data
* Visual indicators (colors, fonts, italics) not used
* Consistent names
* Consistent date formats
* Short, descriptive language (avoid abstract codes)
* Use consistent value for missing data (NaN, -9999, blank OK for pandas)
* Data uniquely assigned to a single table
* Saved as plain text format (CSV)


## Tidy Data Exercise

Do the exercise on [Improving Messy Data]  **DECIDE WHICH** 
(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13YnHHDjG_xEaoHJqvVI2U8cJeNgeOyAJ/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=110380986407305818312&rtpof=true&sd=true)

## How to Discover Data

<br />

| Scientific Data Discovery | Streaming Video |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
Informally between researchers | your mom's emails |
Via project or institutional website | a link at nbc.com |
Referenced in a journal article | via a blog review |
Discoverable within specialized archive, or repository | AppleTV or Netflix |
Discoverable in network of repositories (Data.gov, DataONE) |   IMDB |



::: {.notes}
* advisor -> student
* need search terms
* within text (methods, acknowledgment) or as data citation
* Become familiar with relevant repositories
* Last is easiest if you don't know what you are looking for

`Signature` data is a cross between the first 2


:::


## LTER Data Management Requirements

* Sites must have an integrated Information Management System
* Data available online within two years of collection
* Sites should submit data to repositories
* Long-term (>20 years) usability of data
* Metadata

## Where is NGA LTER Data Available?

> https://search.dataone.org/portals/NGALTER/About-the-Data-Catalog

* Portal supplied by DataONE
* Data and Metadata is stored in the `Research Workspace` member node

#### Let's explore it


## Data Portal Powered by Metadata
