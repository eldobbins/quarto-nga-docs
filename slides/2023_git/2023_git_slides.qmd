::: {.notes}
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so you can recall a specific version later.

- collaboration
- management
- transparency
- reproducibility

::: {.notes}
- reuse existing tools
- tools get better over time as people contribute
- ability to adapt to your own needs (forks and branches)

## What are git and GitHub?

| git    | GitHub |
|--------|--------|
| Version control system   | Web-based hosting system for git repositories |
| Primarily command line   | Graphical User Interface (GUI) |
| Functions without GitHub | Most popular of several hosting options |
| Helps you and future-you | Publishing and project management |

::: {.notes}
- start a local repository and working directory
- track changes to a file locally
- add changes to a staging area and commit them to the local repo

## Adrienne’s notes

::: {.notes}

- Have powershell and gitbash ready
- Touch is ‘ni’ in powershell
- The SSH is indeed tricky, I can demo it quickly but it can’t be a part of our code-along, I think it would just be way too intense
- Then the NGA IM docs as a demo in clone, push, pull
