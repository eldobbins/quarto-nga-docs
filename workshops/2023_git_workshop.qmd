In Feb. 2023, we had a one day workshop within NGA LTER via Zoom to practice git and GitHub. The slides were presented in Google Slides, 
but later converted to `markdown` and rendered to `revealjs` using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

## One Day Git Workshop, 2023 {#git}

This one day workshop is meant as a refresher of the skills we practiced in 2021's [Beginning Scientific Programming for NGA LTER Graduate Students](https://nga-lter.github.io/2021-01-04-ngalter/). The workshop will begin with a short presentation of the importance of version control; this portion focuses on the themes of collaboration and inclusivity championed by the [Openscapes](https://openscapes.org) project.

Following that orientation is a one hour participatory practice session working through parts of the Software Carpentries [Git Novice Lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/).
