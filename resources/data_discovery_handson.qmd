## Introduction

The [Long-Term Ecological Research](https://lternet.edu/about/) (LTER) program requires all sites to publish their data online within two years of collection. However, they do not specify _where_ data must be published. The [Northern Gulf of Alaska](https://nga.lternet.edu) (NGA LTER) has chosen to publish our data via Axiom Data Science's [Research Workspace](https://researchworkspace.com/intro/) (RW). Most other LTER sites submit their data to the [Environmental Data Initiative](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/home.jsp) (EDI). How could an investigator find datasets from multiple LTER sites if they are archived in different repositories?

[DataONE](https://dataone.org/) (Data Observation Network for Earth) was established by the National Science Foundation as a network of data repositories. Data collections are held in separate "member" repositories but are searchable via a central interface. A list of member institutions is found at https://www.dataone.org/network/. Both Research Workspace and EDI are members of DataONE, so it would be a good search interface for investigators hoping to integrate data from several LTER sites.

This hands-on activity provides a chance to explore the DataONE portal and to practice searching for data using their interface.

## Instructions

### Plan your search

Think about the research you are doing. Think of a way you could expand it to include existing datasets. Some examples might include:

* Comparing your data to other LTER sites such as:
  * California Curent (LTER Site CCE)
  * Beaufort Lagoon (BLE)
  * Terrestrial Alaskan sites like Arctic LTER (ARC) or Bonanza Creek (BNZ)
* Comparing your data to other research programs or organizations in the Gulf of Alaska, such as: 
  * GLOBEC
  * Alaska Department of Fish and Game
  * USGS
  * Exxon Valdeze Oil Spill Trustee Council (EVOS)
  * NOAA
* Data of the same type or collected using the same instrument, using terms like:
  * glider
  * grazing rates
  * trace metals

Before you start searching, take a moment to describe what you are looking for:

<br/>
And underline keywords that might be useful.

### Look for Datasets

Go to https://search.dataone.org/data and experiment with different searches:

1. Try searching by `Location`, `Data Attribute`, `Member Node`, etc.
2. Try using the `free text search`
3. Use the author names from one search result to perhaps turn up more relevant records

### Result Evaluation

During your search, pick 3 results and record relevant information about them here:


#### Dataset 1

**Dataset title**

**Authors/Organization**

**Description**

**Download format (if available)**

**How did you find it?**


#### Dataset 2

**Dataset title**

**Authors/Organization**

**Description**

**Download format (if available)**

**How did you find it?**


#### Dataset 3

**Dataset title**

**Authors/Organization**

**Description**

**Download format (if available)**

**How did you find it?**


### Final Questions for Discussion

* Could you find what you wanted?
* What metadata was important in your search?
* Did you end up focusing on a single repository?  Would it have been faster to go directly there?
